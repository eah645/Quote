          First known as Sir Arther Ignatius Conan Doyle, he was well known for his creation of Sherlock Holmes. He was born to Charles Altamont and Mary Foley. In 1868, he began Jesuit education in Landcashire, England. He furthered his education through an additional year in Feldkirch, Austria. Due to his mother's lodger, Dr. Bryan Charles Waller, Doyle was set to enter the University of Edinburgh's Medical School. After completing a thesis in 1885, he gained a Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery qualifications, along with an M.D.<br>
          While he was still a student, he was deeply influenced by his professor, Dr. Joseph Bell. He had a skill in noticing the most minute detail of a patient's condition. His skills became a model for Sherlock Holmes, who first appeared in <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> in 1887.<br>
          The public loved the idea of Sherlock Holmes, and encouraged Doyle to continue writing through 1926. The short stories he wrote then were collected in volumes, while he also wrote novels to include Holmes' assistant, Dr. Watson. Despite the overwhelming success of Sherlock Holmes, Doyle believed it overshadowed his other historical fiction he had written.<br>
          In 1885, Boyle married Louisa Hawkins. They had two children, Mary and Kingsley. Unfortunately, Louisa passed in 1906. Doyle then married Jean Leckie, having three more children together: Denis, Adrian, and Jean.<br>
